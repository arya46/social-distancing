Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
It is the most dealiest virus humanity has ever seen in recent times. It spreads from person to person through contact or if you're within close proximity of an infected person. 


It has so far infected millions of people and claimed over hundreds of thousands lives globally. Around 213 countries have been affected so far by this deadly virus.


In a fight against this virus, the only way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is Social Distancing. Keeping a safe distance from each other is the ultimate way to prevent the spread of this disease (at least until a vaccine is found).


This project is an attempt to monitor if people are following social distancing norms or not.

This app can be used in 3 different modes:
- **Image**: Monitors social distancing norms on an still image.
- **Video**: Monitors social distancing norms on a video.
- **Real-time**: Monitors social distancing norms on a real-time video.
